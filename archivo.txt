	Emotional learning is a process of evolving social and emotional abilities of an individual to
identify, understand, and accomplish the emotions. Emotional intelligence capabilities, such as
expressing, understanding, and managing emotions, can be improved by specialized training to deal
with everyday social matters.
	There are several studies where emotional intelligence has been taught to kids in a variety
of ways. Nathanson investigated that there is a strong need for social and emotional learning to
students as well as teachers. Authors also discovered that the way tutors and learners process and
respond to emotions can either improve or obstruct the social and emotional development of a
child.
	Ulutas and Omeroglu hypothesized that the emotional intelligence of kids could be
increased. They designed an educational program, and after passing through this program,the
emotional intelligence of kids was examined. After 12 weeks of training, the emotional intelligence
of the children was checked using the Sullivan Emotional Intelligence Scale, and the experimental
results were compared using covariance analysis. A T-test based final result of the experimental
study showed that the education program contributed signifcantly to increase children's emotional
intelligence.
